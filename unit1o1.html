        <h2>1.1  Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        IT has become a vital part of most businesses irrespective of their size.  Businesses would struggle to perform without a working IT system. A key aspect of IT business is email which is usually the principal method of communication between employees, suppliers and customers in many businesses.  Using email means that the user can access and share information quickly and easily with whoever they need to. Another example is how IT has changed how inventory is managed.  Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a pre-determined amount.

        <h2>1.2 Describe the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2>
    <p>
        To complete a digital project successfully, you would need a digital project manager with the following skills - good communication, attention to detail, ability to meet deadlines, problem solving, ability to adapt and knowledge of the software. Regarding methodology, you would need to investigate which project management tool was best suited to the project e.g. WBS/Gantt/CPM/Waterfall/lKanban 
        <a href ="https://www.projectcentral.com/blog/project-management-techniques/">[1]</a>
        The resources/tools required would differ per project.  They could be people, equipment, facilities or funding.  However, the basic requirements would be a computer, the material required for the project and software.
    </p>

    <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h2> 
    <p>
        To manage my website project, I am using Trello which is a collaboration tool that organises your project into boards. Trello shows you what is being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
        <a href ="https://help.trello.com/article/708-what-is-trello">[2]</a>
        For every step of the project, I will detail what is required on a board and give it a due date. Trello’s clear layout means that I will be able to instantly see which tasks are due/overdue. I will also update the board accordingly when things change.

    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h2>
    <p>
        There are many possible risks to a digital project – technological, budgetary and human. For example, your project worked with the latest version of iOS then Apple releases a new update which it does not work with.
        <a href ="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care">[3}</a>
        Spending all the budget/going over budget, missing the deadline and the project is not yet finished or has not delivered the intended result.  Poor communication with the team/stakeholder could lead to project delays.  Then there is always the worry of cybercrime or hackers destroying/stealing your work. 
     </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h2>
    <p>
        When deciding which IT systems and software to use on a project, you would need to assess what you need to achieve your goal.  You would also need to factor how much budget you had to buy the IT systems and software as well as who was going to use it.  For this website project, as I did not have a budget I chose Trello as my project management tool as it was free.   As I am a beginner, Trello suited my needs as I was able to learn how to use it quickly and easily.  The features were easy to use and understand.
    </p>
    <div>

    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Trello has helped me plan my project.  I used it to record everything that I need to do and updated it when activities changed, and new actions were needed. 
        I have used GitHub less but I can see that it would be a very useful tool in the future when I had more digital projects.  I could use it to store all future projects and it would be an additional backup of all my work. The version control would be useful as each time you upload work then edit it, you have a timestamp and a record of each change you have made.  You can monitor your progress with a project – you can record why you made a change and see the result. 
        People can see your work on GitHub and you can see their work which could provide inspiration.

    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2></div>

    <p>
        It is very important when designing a digital project that it complies with the current legislation of the countries that will be using
        it. For example in the UK, there are 7 legal requirements that a business website need to follow.    
        <a href = "https://www.hallaminternet.com/internet-marketing-and-the-law-legal-issues-affecting-you-and-your-website/">[4]</a>
        GDPR (general data protection regulation) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area.   It has seven principles, the newest of which is accountability. The aim of GDPR is to ensure that an individuals’ personal data is protected. Accountability means that Companies must ensure that they keep personal data safe and it be only accessible to those who need to. <a href = "https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018">[5]</a>
