    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
</div>
<p>
    I created a five page website.  The first page is the home page where I give a short introduction to why I wanted to learn coding. I added a Code Nation image that takes you to the Code Nation website. I included a navigation bar and tried to reduce its opacity so that the background came through. I coded the sections on the navigation bar so that they changed colour when you clicked on them. Pages 2,3 and 4 contained the answers to the assignment questions we had to answer.  Each page has the same background. I chose to have a box around each question and answer so the information would stand out. The final page is a little bit of fun.  It is about my favourite tv programme – Supernatural.  For this page, I used an image of the main characters as the background.  I changed the colour of the main header to fit in with the colour palette of the image.

    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites  </h2>
</div>
<p>
    Copyright means the “right to copy” and it gives protection to the owners of material – artistic, musical, written or dramatic. Every country has different copyright laws.   You need to know whether you have the permission to use the material you are including. 
    <a href ="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/11/03/copyright-internet-and-you/">[6]</a> Other constraints that effect a website are technological.  This could be browser compatibility or the resolution you use. <a href ="https://www.bestmultimedia.com/blog/navigating-obstacles-and-technical-constraints-in-web-design/">[7]</a> A website developer needs to ensure that their website appears correctly whether it is on a mobile phone screen or a laptop.

    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h2>
<p>
    It is important that websites are designed in a way so that people with disabilities can use them.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case therefore excluding people from accessing products and services. If you are blind/visually impaired, there needs to be “audio description of visual information”.  This is information to accurately describe what can be seen on the screen. The website also needs to include extra time for those scenes which need additional description so the user has time to hear everything. As visually impaired people use screen readers (software application that interprets what is on the screen). It is important that websites are coded in a way so that the reader can correctly interpret the information. For example, each page should be given a unique title so that reader can discern it is a different page.  <a href ="https://www.boia.org/blog/the-most-common-web-accessibility-issues-to-avoid">[8]</a>

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2> 
<p>
    It is important that you use the appropriate file types for your website.  You can break the types into three – presentation, media and documents. For presentation, you could use either JPEG, GIF or PNG for images. HTML would be used for the web page and CSS to enhance the appearance of the website.  For media – you have either MP3, MP4 or AVI which is video format.  Finally ,the filetypes to use for documents would be doc, pdf or xls.
