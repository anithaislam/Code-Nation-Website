        <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Building a website is a time-consuming process.  There is the HTML and CSS code to write as well as testing each change made to the code. 
        For this project, as we were all beginners, it could have been beneficial to work in a team.  You could share the building of the website.  And as always, you would benefit from the experience/knowledge of your team members.
        The advantage of VS Code is everyone could work on a part of the website e.g. a page which would divide the workload.  You could also allocate tasks in Trello to the team.

        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        There are two parts to improving productivity and efficiency.  There is the human aspect and the technological.  It is recognised that a happy employee is a productive employee so organizing celebrations/treats will motivate staff.  Encouraging people to take regular breaks from their desk contributes to people’s wellbeing which in turn effects productivity and efficiency.  Ensuring people have the best tools for the job whether that is the most current equipment or training will also improve efficiency. Productivity can be improved by saying no to meetings, delegating tasks, setting deadlines to ensure tasks are finished in time. If you measure productivity, you can learn what is working or needs improving.

        <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?   </h2>
    <p>
        To improve productivity on a future digital project, I would prefer to work with a team. As I am currently am a beginner, working with more experienced team members would help achieve the end target.  Working collaboratively would also mean that productivity and efficiency would be increased as opposed to working on my own.  Using Slack would fit in with working in a team as information could be shared quickly and easily even if team members were working remotely.
    </p>

    <div>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2> 
    <p>
        To test digital solutions, you need to be aware of exactly what results you are aiming to achieve. It would be important to create a detailed checklist with every expected scenario to ensure you robustly tested your solution before signing it off. This would needed to be completed to ensure you have achieved your expected result. You would need to make sure that you had included time for testing in the project plan so that it was carried out.
