    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
</div>
<p>
    Visual Studio Code and Trello were the perfect beginner tools to build my website.  However, as I became more experienced, I could require additional functionality/features that VS code and Trello do not have. I would need to do further research to investigate whether there were alternatives that provided different/better results.  Also, I could look at the different HTML5 tools that could be used to further enhance a website e.g. Adobe Dreamweaver.

    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
</div>
<p>
    As a beginner, I think that Visual Studio Code and Trello were great tools to build a website.  Both tools were free to download from the web which is perfect when you have no budget. VS Code meant that I was able to enter HTML and CSS code and see my website in internet explorer. Trello was a useful tool to monitor my progress on my project. It did not take me a long time to create the boards I required to manage my project.

    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  </h2>
<p>
    I am happy that I was able to create a website when a week ago I knew next to nothing about HTML and CSS. This is a strength.  My project’s weakness is perhaps the simplicity of the website. I would have liked to have added more complex features which I did not have the time to research, understand and apply.  I am not happy with my final colour palette.  If I had more time, I would change it.  It was a real eye opener to realize how time consuming it is to select the “perfect” colour combination.  I would also have benefitted from more time to work on my website.

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2> 
<p>
    I am going to spend time studying HTML and CSS using the various resources available on the internet e.g. the w3schools website. From this, I hope to include the more complex features I did not know how to add originally. For example, I would like to have included a drop-down list. Also, I would like to research how to improve certain features e.g. the design of the navigation bar. 
</p>

    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
<p>
The outcome of the project was to create a website.  I did create a website.  However, the website did not meet my personal goal as it’s subject matter was not what I originally planned.  I wanted to create a fan website with images and text. I wanted to divide each page into sections with different information in each part.  I was unable to build this design as my HTML and CSS skills were not advanced enough.  Consequently, I changed my design to something I would be able to build within the time constraints.
